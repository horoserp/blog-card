## Overview

The challenge was to recreate a page to display various social links from scratch. I was given three screenshots of the final page: one mobile, one desktop and one showing the hover state. I was supplied the color pallete and fonts.

## My process

I started this challenge by creating the HTML. Then I tackled the CSS systematically from top down. The last step was deployment to GitHub Pages.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This project gave me further practice in the use of CSS Flexbox designs. I took this opportunity to gain my practice using React and CSS.

### Continued development

I would like to continue to focus on efficient CSS and thorough Accessibility.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This is a great reference site which helped me remember some of the required syntax and generalities surrounding the base of a react project.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - This is an excellent resource for finding answers to precise questions. I used it once or twice during this challenge.
